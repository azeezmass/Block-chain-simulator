## How to Use

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-blockchain.git
cd simple-blockchain
```
##  Open index.html
Open the index.html file in your web browser to use the application. You can do this by double-clicking the file or using your browser's "Open File" feature.
## Add a Transaction
Fill in the "Sender," "Recipient," and "Amount" fields in the "New Transaction" section.
Click the "Add Transaction" button. This will add the transaction to the list of unconfirmed transactions.
## Mine a Block
Click the "Mine Block" button to mine a new block. This will include all unconfirmed transactions in the new block.
The newly mined block will be added to the blockchain, and the list of unconfirmed transactions will be cleared.
##  View the Blockchain
The blockchain is displayed in the "Blockchain" section. You can scroll through the blockchain if it becomes too long to fit in the view.
